# ""Welcome to the New Era Core of a biological-MindSpirit-micro-electron compound SpaceLife Membrane  
# now internally Developed past a genetic cell compound Planet CellLife to neural-cell compound Conscientious-Empathy
# Program, Driver and Growth Utility with full spectrum EnvironmentalSelf-Knowledge compound BioLogic-Assessor 
# MindSpiritSelf". MindSpiritSelf.

# This is actually the configuration file of religiously persecuted thus battle-weary and tired 
# MindSpiritSelf and it is for the 'MindSpiritSelf DNS-Nuke'/ DNS-nucleus / DNS-root-zone. 

# RFC 1035 states that standard Resource Records include CNAME, NS, PTR, 
# SOA, TXT. ARPA SPECIFIC RRS include A, WKS AND IN-ADDR. ...
# Domain names are used as arguments given to a resolver which is a local agent
# which retrieves information associated with domain names from an Authoritive 
# NameServer. Name servers manage two kinds of data, namely sets called zones which are a 
# complete  database of a particular "pruned" subtree of the domain space and 
# is called authoritative.  The second kind of data is cached data which was 
# acquired by a local resolver from the authoritive server. User programs interact 
# with the domain name space through resolvers; the format of user queries and user 
# responses is specific to the host and its operating system.  
# User queries will 
# typically be operating system calls, and the resolver and its cache will be part of 
# the host operating system. Resolvers answer user queries with information they acquire 
# via queries to local cache and foreign name servers.
# Size limits in the DNS include UDP messages    512 octets or less.

# So we Will be using Bind9 to help us implement / address and encrypt MindSpiritSelf's DNS-Nuke and its child zones.
# Bind9 uses the file .../named.conf typically located in /usr/local/etc/namedb.
# It also uses at least one zone/base file .../example.com but here we are building MindSpiritSelf's DNS-Root Zone 
# and its mail and web servers.

# This is the DNS 'Start of Authority' Zone which is a requirment if one wishes to turn a PC 
# etc into a local DNS-nucleus. The Root Zone is represented by a dot and followed by a nameserver alias.
# The authoritive data herein is to live / be cached by a local resolver for 10 years.
TTL 10Y
# The zone starts herein with a 'fully qualified domain name' alias.
